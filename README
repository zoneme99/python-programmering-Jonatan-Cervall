## Resources

Many exercises and lecture materials are in form of Jupyter notebooks with **.ipynb** extensions. Sometimes GitHub may not load them correctly for preview, then you can use [Open in Colab][colab_addon], which is an addon in Chrome to open the notebook in Colab. Alternatively, you can go to [jupyter nbviewer][nbviewer], and paste the link to the notebook for previewing. When working with exercises it is important that you create your own notebooks (.ipynb) or script files (.py).

[nbviewer]: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
[colab_addon]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo?hl=sv

When installing softwares, unless anything else is stated in the resources, just click next.

When you have finished the exercises in this repo, you can work in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
